# Presentation

In addition to the written report, your team will also create presentation slides (e.g. with [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/intl/en_en/slides/about/) with an adequate [template](https://slidesgo.com/themes)) that summarize and showcase your project.

Introduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and discuss the primary conclusions.

These slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your written report and will be graded for content and quality.

**For submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document, and submit the PDF of the slides on Moodle.**


Here is a *suggested* outline as you think through the slides; you **do not** have to use this exact format for the 6 slides.

-   Title Slide
-   Introduce the topic and motivation
-   Introduce the data
-   Highlights from EDA
-   Models
-   Interesting findings from the model
-   Conclusions + future work
